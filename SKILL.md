# Grove One-on-One Framework

Design and conduct effective one-on-one meetings using Andy Grove's methodology from High Output Management. The 1:1 is the manager's most important meeting: "This is the one time when problems can be caught early."

---

## When to Use

- Manager needs to improve 1:1 effectiveness
- 1:1s feel unproductive or routine
- Important issues are not surfacing until too late
- Team members seem disconnected or unengaged
- Question of "how do I run better 1:1s?"
- New manager needs 1:1 structure

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| context | Yes | Manager role, team member role, relationship history |
| current_state | No | How 1:1s currently work (or do not work) |
| specific_challenges | No | Particular issues to address |
| frequency | No | Current or planned 1:1 cadence |

---

## Grove's 1:1 Framework

### Why 1:1s Matter

Grove considered the 1:1 one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can do:

> "The one-on-one should be regarded as the subordinate's meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him."

**Key insight:** The 1:1 is not a status update. It is a forum for problems to surface before they become crises.

### Core Principles

#### 1. It Is the Subordinate's Meeting

The subordinate owns the agenda. The manager's job is to:
- Create space for problems to emerge
- Ask questions that surface concerns
- Listen more than talk
- Coach, not direct

> "The supervisor is there to learn and to coach."

**Anti-pattern:** Manager fills the meeting with their own updates and directives.

#### 2. Minimum Time, Maximum Frequency

Grove recommended:
- **Duration:** At least 1 hour
- **Frequency:** At least every 2 weeks (weekly for new employees or changing situations)

**Why 1 hour minimum:** Short meetings encourage only surface-level updates. Substantive issues need time to emerge.

> "An hour seems too long if you think of the 1:1 as a status meeting. If it's seen as the place to explore problems and coach the subordinate, then an hour is barely enough."

#### 3. Location and Setting

**Grove's recommendation:** Hold the meeting in or near the subordinate's workspace.

**Rationale:**
- Subordinate is more comfortable on their turf
- Manager can observe the working environment
- Reduces power differential

**Alternative for remote:** Video call with cameras on; subordinate controls the "space" by leading the discussion.

#### 4. Task-Relevant Maturity Guides Style

| TRM Level | 1:1 Focus | Manager Role |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Low** | Training, specific task guidance | Teaching, directing |
| **Medium** | Problem-solving, development | Coaching, advising |
| **High** | Strategic alignment, challenges | Listening, supporting |

**Remember:** TRM is task-specific. The same person may need different approaches for different responsibilities.

## 1:1 Structure

### Preparation (Before the Meeting)

**Subordinate prepares:**
- Written list of topics/concerns
- Updates on previous action items
- Questions or decisions needed

**Manager prepares:**
- Review previous 1:1 notes
- Prepare specific questions
- Identify coaching opportunities

**Grove's rule:** Both parties should come prepared. Unprepared 1:1s waste the hour.

### Opening (5-10 minutes)

**Start with:** "What's on your mind?"

**Purpose:** Let the subordinate set direction. Do not immediately jump to your agenda.

**Good opening questions:**
- "What's the most important thing we should talk about today?"
- "What's worrying you that you haven't had a chance to discuss?"
- "If there's one thing I could help you with this week, what would it be?"

### Core Discussion (40-50 minutes)

**Subordinate-led topics** should dominate. Common areas:

| Category | Sample Topics |
|----------|--------------|
| **Blockers** | Obstacles preventing progress, decisions needed |
| **Concerns** | Things that feel wrong but are not yet problems |
| **Development** | Career growth, skill gaps, aspirations |
| **Relationships** | Team dynamics, cross-functional issues |
| **Feedback** | Questions about performance, seeking guidance |

**Manager's role during discussion:**

1. **Ask, do not tell:** "What have you tried?" "What do you think we should do?"
2. **Surface the real issue:** Often the stated topic is not the actual concern
3. **Coach toward solutions:** Help them solve, do not solve for them
4. **Note patterns:** Recurring themes signal deeper issues

### Closing (5-10 minutes)

**Review:**
- Key takeaways from discussion
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Topics to continue next time

**Grove's question:** "Is there anything else?" (Wait for the answer. The important thing often comes last.)

**Document:** Brief notes after the meeting. Track action items.

## Diagnostic Questions

### For Managers Running 1:1s

**Structure assessment:**

| Question | Good Sign | Warning Sign |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Who sets the agenda? | Subordinate | Manager |
| What percentage do you talk? | <30% | >50% |
| Do problems surface early? | Yes | Only when crisis |
| Do they bring real concerns? | Yes | Only status updates |
| How often rescheduled? | Rarely | Frequently |

**Effectiveness assessment:**

- When was the last time you learned something important in a 1:1?
- When was the last time a 1:1 prevented a crisis?
- Do subordinates look forward to 1:1s or endure them?

### For Subordinates in 1:1s

| Question | Good Sign | Warning Sign |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Do you prepare? | Written topics | Wing it |
| Do you raise concerns? | Before they are crises | Only when unavoidable |
| Do you get coaching? | Specific, helpful | Generic or none |
| Are you heard? | Manager remembers and follows up | Repeating yourself |

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: The Status Meeting

**Symptom:** 1:1 is just a verbal status report that could be email.

**Fix:** Ban pure status updates. Status goes in writing before the meeting. Meeting time is for what cannot be written.

### Anti-Pattern 2: The Manager Monologue

**Symptom:** Manager uses 1:1 to share information, give direction, talk about their concerns.

**Fix:** Manager speaks last and least. Time yourself. If you talk more than 30%, stop.

### Anti-Pattern 3: The Skipped Meeting

**Symptom:** 1:1s frequently rescheduled or canceled.

**Fix:** Treat 1:1s as sacred. Canceling signals "you are not important."

### Anti-Pattern 4: The Surface Conversation

**Symptom:** Conversation stays safe; real issues never emerge.

**Fix:** Ask deeper questions. "What are you not telling me?" "What's the elephant in the room?" Create psychological safety.

### Anti-Pattern 5: No Follow-Through

**Symptom:** Same issues discussed repeatedly; action items forgotten.

**Fix:** Document and track. Start each 1:1 reviewing previous action items.

### Grove's Principle

> "[Relevant Grove quote about 1:1s, management, or communication]"
```

---

## Constraints

- 1:1s are not a substitute for regular feedback; issues should not wait for the scheduled meeting
- The framework assumes basic psychological safety; if trust is broken, 1:1 effectiveness will be limited regardless of structure
- Remote 1:1s require extra attention to nonverbal cues
- Cultural context matters; some cultures require more structured approaches to raising concerns

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Subordinate does not prepare | Co-create preparation template; make expectation explicit |
| Subordinate only shares good news | Ask specifically about concerns; create safety for bad news |
| Manager constantly cancels | Escalate as management failure; pattern undermines trust |
| 1:1 feels awkward or forced | Start with relationship building; forced structure makes it worse |
| Too many direct reports | Minimum viable 1:1 (30 min biweekly); consider org restructure |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a new engineering manager with 5 direct reports. I've been doing weekly 30-minute 1:1s but they feel like status updates. I do most of the talking. How do I make them more effective?"

**Output:**

## 1:1 Framework Assessment: New Engineering Manager

### Current State

**Meeting frequency:** Weekly (good)
**Typical duration:** 30 minutes (too short)
**Who owns the agenda:** Manager (problem)
**Primary anti-patterns:** Status meeting, manager monologue

### Effectiveness Assessment

| Dimension | Current | Target | Gap |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Problems surface early | No | Yes | Critical |
| Subordinate prepares | Unknown | Yes | Unknown |
| Manager listens > talks | No | Yes | Critical |
| Action items tracked | Unknown | Yes | Unknown |
| Meetings protected | Unknown | Yes | Unknown |

**Root issue:** You are treating 1:1s as your meeting to manage them. They should be their meeting to be supported.

### Task-Relevant Maturity Analysis

| Subordinate | Key Tasks | TRM Level | 1:1 Style Needed |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| New hires / juniors | Feature delivery, codebase learning | Low-Medium | More directing, teaching |
| Experienced engineers | Complex projects, architecture | Medium-High | Coaching, problem-solving |
| Senior engineers | Technical leadership, mentoring | High | Listening, supporting |

**Note:** With 5 reports, you can personalize. Adjust style per person.

### Recommended Structure

**Frequency:** Keep weekly (appropriate for new manager relationship)
**Duration:** Extend to 45-60 minutes
**Location:** Their desk/space if in-office; camera on for remote

**Agenda template:**
1. **Opening (5 min):** "What's on your mind?"
2. **Their topics (30-40 min):** Problems, concerns, blockers, growth
3. **Your topics (5-10 min):** Only if time remains and truly needed
4. **Closing (5 min):** Recap actions, "Anything else?"

### Specific Improvements

**Stop doing:**
- Leading with your updates
- Talking more than 30% of the time
- Using 1:1 as status meeting

**Start doing:**
- Send prep prompt 24 hours before: "Please come with 1-3 topics you want to discuss"
- Ask questions, then wait (silence is okay)
- Take notes on their concerns, not just action items

**Continue doing:**
- Weekly cadence (good instinct)
- Scheduling at all (many new managers don't)

### Sample Questions to Use

**Opening:**
- "What's the most important thing for us to discuss today?"
- "What's been on your mind this week?"

**Going deeper:**
- "What's an obstacle you've been working around that we should fix?"
- "What don't I know about that you think I should?"
- "If you could change one thing about how we work, what would it be?"
- "What are you learning? What do you want to learn?"

**Closing:**
- "Is there anything else?"
- "What can I do to help you before next week?"

### Implementation Plan

| Week | Change | How to Measure |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Extend to 45 min; send prep prompt; time yourself | Talk time < 30% |
| 2-4 | Practice asking and waiting; note patterns | Subordinates bring real topics |
| Ongoing | Track concerns over time; follow up on actions | Problems surface before crisis |

### Grove's Principle

> "The one-on-one should be regarded as the subordinate's meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. The supervisor is there to learn and to coach."

Your 1:1s feel like status updates because you have them backwards. Flip the ownership. Your job is not to update them or direct them; it is to create a space where they bring you problems early, so you can coach them before those problems become crises. Talk less. Ask more. Listen.
